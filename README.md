# House Price Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, etc. This predictive model can be useful for real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers to estimate house prices accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [HousePricePrediction.csv](./HousePricePrediction.csv). It contains information about various houses including their features and the corresponding selling prices.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Adityaraj2002git/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open and run the `House_Price_Prediction_ML.ipynb` notebook to train the machine learning model and make predictions.
